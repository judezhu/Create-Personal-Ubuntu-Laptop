My laptop is running quite right now. And it can last more 3 hours now. So just share some experience.

1.install bumblebee.

If your have a nvidia graphical card in your laptop. You must try install bumblebee, then reboot your computer. My computer is fixed in this way.

2.install jupiter.

jupiter is very useful for monitoring your cpu temperature and make your cpu consumption is in the on-demand mode.

3.install powertop

powertop give your more details about how's everything going of each component in your computer. After I installed bumblebee, powertop told me that all my PCI consumption issues have been fixed.

Hopefully, this is helpful for you if you have the same problem with me.
