## Set up Pinyin on Ubuntu 14.o4

Oh my god! it took me forver to get 14.04 set up. Here I will record the procedures to fix the pinyin input method. I use ibus pinyin, so here all about ibus.

1. Go to ```system-setting``` and choose ```text-entry``` to add chinese input source.
2. Go to ```ibus-setting``` to add ```ibus-pinyin```. where run command:
        $ibus-setup
3. then use short-cut ```super``` + ```white space``` to change between English and Chinese.
